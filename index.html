                 <h3><em>Background</em></h3>
                 <p>Hello, my name is Rafael Lorenzo Tangga, but people call me Enzo. I was born in the Philippines as the youngest of 5 children, with an age gap of 7 years between me and the 2nd youngest. I moved to Australia with my family when I was 2 and grew with people talking to me in English and Tagalog. Despite that I only gained fluency in only English and can only understand what people are saying when they speak Tagalog and can’t speak myself.
                </p>
                
                <h3><em>Education and Work Experience</em></h3>
                <p>I finished primary school at a place called <a href="https://www.brentwoodparkps.vic.edu.au">Brentwood Park Primary School</a> and Finished High school next door to my primary school at a place called <a href="https://www.kambryacollege.vic.edu.au">Kambrya College</a>. Throughout my studies I was able to finish multiple courses which include: A Sport & Rec VET course, A First Aid Training Course, A Mental Health First Aid Course and A Manual Handling Training Course. Most of the courses and trainings were required for my current job as a junior disability support worker. I work at an organisation called <a href="https://www.ioe.org.au">Interchange Outer East (IOE)</a>, which assist in the care of people with disabilities to help them at home or during recreational activities. I have only recently started working here however I have been volunteering there for most of my high school life. Also the proud creator of "hit" Youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWm3QTp-ruY&t=16s"> Fun games with enzo.</a>

                <h3><em>Hobbies</em></h3>
                <p>I would very much label myself as a geek or a weeb. I love anime and manga and was influenced to watch it by my siblings ever since I was a child and I have continued to watch/read it even long after they grew out of it and stopped watching a lot. Also, just like most people my age I enjoy my fair share of video games, The main games that I play are either strategy turn bases RPGs like fire emblem or Persona 5, or Souls games like Sekiro or Elden Ring. My final Main hobby is Dungeons and Dragons (DND), Me and my friends started playing it just before the first lockdown. My groups have multiple different stories with different people acting as the Dungeon Master, but the longest running one is the campaign I created.

                <h3><em>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</em></h3>
                <p>
                    My main interest in IT is using it to build and create video games. Ever since I was a child, I always wanted to create games and despite the fact that the hyper realistic virtual reality technology I imagined myself creating isn’t a thing yet, I am still interested in the creation of past and modern video games alike. Furthermore, the fact that IT is becoming more and more prevalent as time goes on is very appealing to me, as it ensures that I will most likely be able to get a decent job if I succeed in learning how to do IT.

                <h3><em>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </em></h3>
                <p>
                    There are a few reasons for me to come to RMIT. The first reason is the fact that it is known to be a very good school when it comes to technology, so it was a really good option for me. Also, I really liked its location, the RMIT city campus is very close to many places so I can easily buy food or clothes if I wanted to do that after classes. I also have cousins that live near RMIT so I can stay with them if I stay around the area too late or if I need to wake up extremely early for a class.

                <h3><em>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</em></h3>
                <p>During my course I expect to learn different coding languages and their applications, as well as the different types of jobs people in IT can do. I also expect to learn how to function as a team during projects and am curious to learn the things we need to keep in mind when working in the IT industry. Furthermore, I expect to learn about different forms of software and hardware that is involved as well as how to efficiently maintain them to a high degree. Overall my ideas of what I expect to learn is the broad detail of IT and the Industry to help me and my classmates survive In the world of IT.

                <h3><em>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</em></h3>
                <p>
                    A game designer’s purpose is self-explanatory, they are the people who design games. This can be broken up to 3 major areas which is the design, art and programming, all of which Interest me as I have always wanted to create games since I was a child. The designers are like the brains of the game creation process, the come up with the ideas, the story, the game play and more and cooperate with the artists and programmers in order to ensure they are following the intended design of the game. The artists are like the skin of the process (This analogy is weird, but I can’t go back now). They are the in charge of the parts that people see. They create everything from the character models to the world the character is in. Finally, the game programmer is the like the muscles of the process they are what allows everything to move and function and are also in charge of creating other aspects like adding multiplayer elements or allowing games to be cross platform.
                </p>
                
                <h3><em>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</em></h3>
                <p> Most games designers require a degree in computer science, game design, software engineering, or graphic design, however they usually accept those with degrees of similar computer-based forms of study. They also need to be able to understand and write common coding languages such as Java, C and C++ and would even benefit in knowing how to create AI, how to do 2D or 3D computer animations or have experience in creative writing. Furthermore, it is advantageous for a person to be interested and/or actively play video games or even be a video game nerd, as companies want people who have experience playing games as they have the knowledge of what makes games good or bad.

                <h3><em>description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</em></h3> 
                <p>I am currently doing a bachelors of IT, despite that not generally being a good match for game design, it is a passible degree to be able to go into it as they are looking for people with experience with coding and other forms of IT knowledge. Furthermore, despite not being great at using the language I have a small amount of experience using Java as it was necessary for my computing subject in school.  Moreover, I am currently very active when it comes to gaming and am generally creative when it comes to storylines and art as I play a lot of Dnd where I have to design my own characters and the storyline of the entire campaign.
